The last book I read was developing your personality by Metropolitan Youssef. This is a religious book in the coptic orthodox church and helps you in your spiritual life. This book spoke mainly about grace and truth and the important of their unity within Christianity. If you have grace without truth, you get confusion and lost followers of Christ. If you separate true with our grace, you get rebellious and angered follows who ultimately do not feel loved by Christ.
